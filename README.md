# Link Hints Manifest V3 Version

<img src="icon.svg" alt="" align="left" style="margin-right: 1em;">

This is a fork of the [Link Hints](https://github.com/lydell/LinkHints) extension by [Simon Lydell](https://github.com/lydell) so it works on Chromium based browsers which require [Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/what-is-mv3).

This version in it's current form is not yet compatible with Firefox.
